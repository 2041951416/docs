Arklet, as an agent for Koupleless module deployment and operations (similar in function to K8S's Kubelet), can be used independently without ModuleController. It exposes a set of HTTP interfaces for installing and uninstalling modules, allowing Koupleless to integrate with your own deployment and operations platform. [See the API documentation here](https://github.com/koupleless/runtime/blob/main/README.md).
